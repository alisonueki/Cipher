# Cipher

This C++ program implements the Hill cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It allows for encoding and decoding messages using a key matrix. The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.

### Description:
- **Encryption**: 
  - The `HillCipher` function encrypts a message using a 3x3 key matrix. The message is transformed into a numerical vector, multiplied by the key matrix, and converted back to characters.
- **Decryption**: 
  - The `decrypt` function decrypts an encrypted message by computing the inverse of the key matrix, then applying it to the encrypted message matrix.
- **Matrix Operations**:
  - **Determinant Calculation**: `determinant` function calculates the determinant of a matrix, which is necessary for finding the matrix's inverse.
  - **Adjoint and Inverse**: `adjoint` and `inverse` functions compute the adjoint and modular inverse of the key matrix, respectively.
  - **Matrix Multiplication**: `encrypt` function performs matrix multiplication to obtain the ciphertext.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - `getKeyMatrix` converts a key string into a 3x3 integer matrix.
  - `modInverse` finds the modular inverse of a number.
  - `getCofactor` helps in finding the cofactor of a matrix element.

The main function:
- Takes user input to choose between encryption and decryption.
- Processes the input message and key matrix.
- Calls appropriate functions to encrypt or decrypt the message based on the userâ€™s choice.

This program demonstrates key operations in Hill cipher encryption and decryption, including matrix manipulation and modular arithmetic.
